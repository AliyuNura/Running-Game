 # Running video gamme using Arduino Uno,LCD and joystick
 
 This is a project that is based on a video game that I found on the internet. This project has many features such as a buzzer for beeping when your character collides or jumps over obstacles. Also, to give it a video game feeling, it has a joystick (must have a button) because you simply press down on the joystick's button to jump. This video game is about you guessed it! (A man running and jumping over obstacles and avoiding them.) The object of this game is about getting as many points as possible (one point for every second you are on the course and avoiding the obstacles).
